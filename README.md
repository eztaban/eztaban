- 👋 Hi, I’m @eztaban
- 👀 I’m interested in programming and data handling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program in Python and practicing by creating small games, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - nothing right now :) I don't have the skillset as of now and I am just training by myself for the moment.
- 📫 How to reach me: iasonasmg@protonmail.com
